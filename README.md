# OpenCV

This repository contains two simple computer vision projects built with OpenCV and TensorFlow/Keras:

Line Detection & Tracing:
A classic OpenCV pipeline that detects and highlights straight lines in any input image using edge detection and Hough Transform.

Handwritten Letter Recognition (A–Z):
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the A–Z Handwritten Alphabet dataset to classify uppercase English letters. Includes a saved model and a test script for predicting letters from new handwritten images.

Main Concepts:

Image preprocessing
Edge detection
Hough line detection
CNN-based image classification
Model saving and inference
OpenCV for real-world image input

This mini-project demonstrates basic computer vision tasks, combining classic OpenCV techniques with deep learning for handwritten character recognition.

Technologies:
OpenCV • TensorFlow/Keras • NumPy • Pandas • scikit-learn
