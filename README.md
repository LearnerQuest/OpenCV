# ✨ Handwritten Letters & Lines — Computer Vision Mini Projects ✨

Welcome! 👋 This repository brings together **two practical computer vision projects** that combine **classic OpenCV techniques** with **modern deep learning** — all written in **pure Python**.

---

## 🟢 1️⃣ Line Detection & Tracing  
> *“Where there are edges, there are lines — let’s find them.”*

A clean OpenCV pipeline that takes any image, finds its edges using **Canny**, then traces straight lines using **Hough Transform**.  
Great for learning how a computer “sees” structure in raw pixels.

---

## 🟢 2️⃣ Handwritten Letter Recognition (A–Z)  
> *“Teaching a machine to read your handwriting, one pixel at a time.”*

A simple but powerful **CNN** trained on thousands of handwritten letters to recognize uppercase **A–Z**.  
Feed it a scribbled letter — get back the predicted character. It’s OCR, made easy.

## ⚙️ What’s Inside

- ✅ OpenCV for classic computer vision  
- ✅ TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning  
- ✅ A–Z dataset from Kaggle — real handwritten alphabets  
- ✅ Training script, saved model, test script  
- ✅ Neat examples and clean, readable code

---

## 🚀 Why This Repo

This is a perfect **mini portfolio project** for anyone learning computer vision fundamentals.

- 🔍 Covers image preprocessing, edge detection, and contour/line analysis  
- 🧠 Introduces neural networks and OCR using real-world handwritten data  
- 💡 Simple, reusable, and open-source — great for further experimentation
