✨ Handwritten Letters & Lines — Computer Vision Mini Projects ✨
Welcome! 👋 This repository brings together two practical computer vision projects that combine classic OpenCV tricks with modern deep learning — all written in pure Python.

🟢 1️⃣ Line Detection & Tracing
“Where there are edges, there are lines — let’s find them.”

A clean OpenCV pipeline that takes any image, finds its edges using Canny, then traces straight lines using Hough Transform. Great for learning how a computer “sees” structure in raw pixels.

🟢 2️⃣ Handwritten Letter Recognition (A–Z)
“Teaching a machine to read your handwriting, one pixel at a time.”

A simple but powerful CNN trained on thousands of handwritten letters to recognize uppercase A–Z. Feed it a scribbled letter — get back the predicted character. It’s OCR, made easy.

⚙️ What’s Inside
✅ OpenCV for classic computer vision
✅ TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning
✅ A-Z dataset from Kaggle — real handwritten alphabets
✅ Training script, saved model, test script
✅ Neat examples and clear code

🚀 Why This Repo
A perfect mini portfolio piece for computer vision fundamentals.

Shows image preprocessing, line detection, edge finding, and character recognition in a single place.

All open-source, fully documented — easy to adapt for your own experiments.
